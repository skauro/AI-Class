How the AI Works (Monte Carlo)
Generates all possible moves.
Simulates 200 random games per move.
Counts wins and draws.
Picks the best move (highest win percentage).
This approach is not perfect, but it plays decently well.




Possible Improvements
Increase N_SIMULATIONS for stronger AI.(but slower)
Optimize simulation speed (e.g., faster win-checking). 
Implement UCT/MCTS for better exploration.
