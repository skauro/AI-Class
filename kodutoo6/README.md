This project implements a Naive Bayes text classifier to categorize BBC news articles into topics like tech, politics, business, entertainment, and sport.

The text preprocessing step involves lowercasing all words and removing short words (length â‰¤ 3).

During training, the model counts word occurrences for each class and stores the log-probabilities with Laplace smoothing in a JSON file (nb_model.json).

For classification, the model sums the log-probabilities of the words and selects the class with the highest total score. 

The classifier achieved an accuracy of 96.00% on the provided test dataset.
