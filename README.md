# üß† AI Fundamentals Projects

Welcome to my **AI Fundamentals** repository! This project contains 10 different AI assignments I completed during my university course. Each commit represents a standalone project focused on a specific AI algorithm. The implementations are mostly written in **Python** and explore a wide range of core AI concepts.

## üìö About the Course

This repository showcases the work I did for my AI Fundamentals class. Each homework introduced a new algorithm or technique, and I implemented it through a hands-on project. The goal was to understand the inner workings of various AI methods by building them from scratch or applying them to real problems.

## üß© Projects Overview

Here‚Äôs a summary of the algorithms and topics covered:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
   - Implemented for finding shortest paths on 2D grids.

2. **Greedy Best-First Search**  
   - Used for heuristic-driven pathfinding problems.

3. **A\* Search**  
   - Combines cost and heuristics for efficient and optimal pathfinding.

4. **Monte Carlo Simulation**  
   - Applied to decision-making in games like Connect Four.

5. **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
   - Used for text classification on real-world datasets (e.g., BBC news).

6. **N-Gram Text Generator**  
   - Generated text using word-based n-gram language models.

7. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
   - Built and trained a CNN for image classification using the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

8. **Q-Learning**  
   - Solved reinforcement learning environments like MountainCar-v0.

9. **Predicate Logic and Reasoning**  
   - Encoded knowledge in logic and used automated provers for reasoning.
